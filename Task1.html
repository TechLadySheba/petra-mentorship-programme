      <h2>How Myles Munroe changed my life</h2>
      <p class="p-1">
        In 2011, I just finished high school and 
        I wasn't sure of what exactly I wanted to do with my life
        I applied for collage as it was the norm, but deep down my heart, 
        wasn't sure if that was what I wanted. My Dad had this usual habit of 
        listening to messages in the house and that whats how I heard Myles 
        Mounroe speaks for the first time, it was a message on relationship
        but then I got so much wisdom as he was laying emphasis on purpose 
        and how understanding purpose can change our lives. And that was how my
        quest to find my purpose in life started. I can say that was the day
        my life changed.

      <p class="">

         Munroe grew up poor in a family of eleven children &#44; 
         Raised in the Nassau constituency of Bain Town, he was a lifelong 
      resident of the Commonwealth. Munroe became a Christian during his
      teenage years, later attending Oral Roberts University (ORU)
        where he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts, Education, and 
        Theology in 1978 and a Master’s degree in administration 
      from the University of Tulsa in 1980. Munroe was also 
      the recipient of honorary doctoral degrees from various schools of 
        higher education and served as an adjunct professor of the Graduate 
        School of Theology at ORU. He wrote a number of books,
          and his first book titled "The Principle and Power of Kingdom 
            Citizenship: Keys to Experiencing Heaven on Earth" and it was 
            published in 1992.

      <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
      <p>
        Following his graduation from the University of Tulsa, 
        Dr. Myles founded Bahamas Faith Ministries International (BFMI) in the early 1980s, 
        he also founded the Myles Munroe International (MMI) – an outreach center which includes  
        leadership training institutes, a missions agency, a publishing company,
         a television network, radio and Web communications, and a church community.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Munroe was especially influential in Africa,  
        arguing that African nations are underdeveloped due to the poor quality of their leaders. 
        “Leadership determines everything in life,” he said. 
        “Nothing happens without leadership. Whether you are talking
         about an organisation, church or nation, everything depends on 
         leadership for success. Leaders determine the quality and attitude of their followers. 
         If your country is not effective, it is the fault of its leaders not its people.”
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Myles Munroe was an incredible teacher and Leader his book on 
        Discovering your purpose changed my life. I remembered
        locking myself inside the house for 3 days to gain clarity on what
        I wanted to do with life, and the books on purpose by Myles gave 
        me the clarity I needed. Myles was one of those great men I planned
        to meet before I died, but unfortunately, I couldn't meet him until his death
        Mr Myles legacy lives on and I am one of those legacy.
